#replacing smash songs with original rip vers - keep in mind that the ver. I found has two versions of each track
#the regular songs (which I used here) are 321 kbps stereo, the others have a _51 appended to the filename and are
#513 kbps 6ch. I used the first, but if the second is better you can use the joshw ver. and append _51 to the end of each track
